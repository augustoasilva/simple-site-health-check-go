# Simple Website Health Check Made With Go

This is just a simple Go application made while I was studying.

## How to use

First clone the repo and get inside the cloned folder:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/augustoasilva/simple-site-health-check-go && cd simple-site-health-check-go 
```

Then compile and run the application with:
```shell
go run app.go
```
